# Gabble
Gabble is a lighthearted project. 

Here is some of what Gabble has been doing.

## Gabble Corrects 2024

As a provision of the Gabble Charter, we are mandated to annually review minor gramatical transgressions across local media.

Our show rounding up these transgressions was broadcast on Channel 31 on Christmas Day 2024.

The recording can be accessed on our YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UuZpHoXziU).
